Description: R implementation of a multivariate meta-analysis model for the difference in restricted mean survival times (RMST). Use this package with individual patient level data for a time-to-event outcome to determine combined effect estimates according to 4 methods: 1)  a univariate meta-analysis using observed treatment effects, 2) a univariate meta-analysis using effects estimated by fitted Royston-Parmar flexible parametric models, 3) multivariate meta-analysis with analytically derived covariance, 4) multivariate meta-analysis with bootstrap derived covariance. This package computes all combined effects and provides an RMSTD curve with option to include combined effect point estimates and their confidence intervals.
