\usage{
RMSTcurves(trialdata, time_horizons, tmax = max(time_horizons),
  tstep = 0.25, nboot = 500, MA_mvma = TRUE, MA_mvma_boot = TRUE,
  MA_uni = TRUE, MA_uni_flex = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{trialdata}{IPD trial data}

\item{time_horizons}{specified vector of time horizons for the meta-analysis}

\item{tmax}{maximum value for RMSTD to be calculated in each trial}

\item{tstep}{increment for calculation of RMSTD over time interval from 0 to tmax; default=0.25}

\item{nboot}{the number of bootstrap iterations, if using the MVMA with bootstrap covariance matrix; default=500}

\item{MA_mvma}{TRUE or FALSE indicates whether to include combined effect by this method}

\item{MA_mvma_boot}{TRUE or FALSE indicates whether to include combined effect by this method}

\item{MA_uni}{TRUE or FALSE indicates whether to include combined effect by this method}

\item{MA_uni_flex}{TRUE or FALSE indicates whether to include combined effect by this method}

\value{
an object to be plotted with \code{\link{RMSTplot}}
}
\description{
Prepare the data for use with \code{\link{RMSTplot}}. This function computes RMSTD over 
specified time horizons and also fits a flexible parametric model to each trial.
It calls the \code{\link{metaRMSTD}} function to compute the estimated combined effects for each of the 4 methods.
